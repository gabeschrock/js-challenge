# Gabeschrock's JavaScript Challenge

Simple rules. Implement arrays and objects in JavaScript. Easy, right? Well, the `object` type isn't allowed, meaning no arrays either. No variable can be stored as an object, no function can return an object, and the only allowed use of objects is when calling standard JavaScript functions like `Math.sin` or `String.fromCharCode`.

I am working on this, but anyone can if they want to. Hint: Closures.
